## Project Architecture.

#### Dir Structure:

All code of the app exist into the `app` directory, all files or folders outside of this directory are configuration files except the android and ios directories.

```
- android/
- ios/
- app/
    - assets/
    - common/
        - http/
        - utils/
    - components/
        - component1/
            - index.ts
        - component2/
    - views/
        view1/
          - index.ts
          - _screen.ts
    - state/
        - module1/
        - module2/
- config/
```

The Redux Store it's contained under the `state` directory, into of this must exist a directory for each module in the store with some minimal files and others optional.

#### Redux Architecture:

In a module of the state, must exist some minimal files and others optionals:

```
_ _duck.ts (Required)
- actions.ts (Required)
- index.ts (Required)
- reducer.ts (Required)
- sagas.ts (Optional)
- selectors.ts (Optional)
- services.ts (Optional)
- types.ts (Required)
```

- **\_duck**: Module definition.
- **actions**: Definitions of bindings with actions creators of the state.
- **index**: Initial point of the module and export.
- **reducer**: Definitions of mutations in the state using the actions creators defined in the types.
- **types**: Definitions of types of actions possibles in the state.
